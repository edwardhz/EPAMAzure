4. I created the Static Web App resource from the Azure Portal. I used GitHub as the source (Connect my Github account and chose repo and branch), and since it was just an HTML website, I chose HTML for Build Presets option. And for App Location option I chose / since the HTML file was in the root folder.

6. Once the resource was created, we can access the website using the URL that the resource provides.

8. When we access the website, it works fine. (Now, every time I push a change to the repository, the website will be updated)
